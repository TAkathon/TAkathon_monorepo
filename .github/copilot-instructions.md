# TAkathon Copilot Instructions

## ⚠️ Git Workflow (Gitflow) - CRITICAL

This is a **modular monolith Nx monorepo** for hackathon team formation with:
- **Frontend Apps**: Three Next.js apps (student-portal, organizer-dashboard, sponsor-panel)
- **Core Gateway**: Express/Node.js backend (Auth, Database, API routing)
- **AI Engine**: FastAPI/Python service (Matching algorithms, AI coaching)
- **Shared Libraries**: TypeScript types, UI components, utilities, shared API client
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with centralized schema and migrations

Data flow: `Next.js Apps → Core Gateway (Express) → [AI Engine (FastAPI) | PostgreSQL]`

## Frontend Development Guidelines

### Design System
- **Theme**: Dark mode by default (`#1A0A00`).
- **Primary Color**: `#D94C1A` (Orange/Rust).
- **UI Pattern**: Glassmorphism (defined in `globals.css`).
- **Component Library**: Lucide React for icons, Tailwind CSS for styling.

### App Structure (Next.js 15)
- Use **App Router** (`src/app`).
- Shared layout components in `src/components/` (e.g., `DashboardLayout`).
- Pages follow a consistent layout: Sidebar, Top bar (search/notifications), Main content area.

### Design Consistency
- **Glassmorphism**: Use the `.glass` class for cards and panels.
- **Buttons**: Use `.btn-primary` and `.btn-secondary` for consistency.
- **Inputs**: Use `.input-field` for form elements.
- **Responsive**: All dashboards must be mobile-friendly (use `md:` or `lg:` for grid/flex layouts).

### Core Concept

### Workflow Rules
1. **NEVER commit directly to `main`** - Only merge from `release/*` or `hotfix/*`
2. **All development happens on `dev`** - Switch to `dev` branch for coding
3. **Create feature branches**: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name dev`
4. **Merge features to `dev`**: Create PR from `feature/*` → `dev`
5. **Releases**: Create `release/*` from `dev`, test, then merge to `main` and `dev`

## Core Domain Models

### Database Tables
Located in `database/schema.sql` and `prisma/schema.prisma`:
- `users` - Student/organizer/sponsor accounts
- `student_profiles`, `organizer_profiles`, `sponsor_profiles` - Role details
- `skills` - Skill taxonomy
- `user_skills` - Many-to-many with proficiency levels
- `hackathons` - Event metadata
- `hackathon_participants` - Registration data
- `teams` - Student-created teams (with creator/captain)
- `team_members` - Team membership
- `team_invitations` - Pending invites and join requests
- `applications` - Team applications
- `sponsorships` - Sponsor contributions

### User Roles
- **Student**: Profile creation, skill setting, hackathon joining, team creation, inviting friends, requesting AI teammate matches
- **Organizer**: Hackathon creation, participant viewing, team overview, data export
- **Sponsor**: Hackathon browsing, team project viewing, talent discovery

## Critical Patterns

### Matching Engine (V1 Algorithm)
Located at `apps/ai-engine/app/matching/` (FastAPI service). Used for **AI teammate recommendations** when students need to fill open team spots.

**Architecture**:
- Client → Core Gateway (Express) → AI Engine (FastAPI)
- Core Gateway handles auth, validation, and data fetching
- AI Engine focuses solely on scoring and recommendation logic

Scoring criteria for candidate matches:
1. Skill complementarity (40%) - Fill gaps in team's skill set
2. Experience level balance (30%) - Mix of proficiencies
3. Availability overlap (30%) - Time zone and commitment match

**Key principle**: Deterministic and replaceable - designed for future ML swap. Clean service boundaries with JSON input/output schemas.

**Usage flow**: Student creates team → invites friends → requests AI suggestions for remaining spots → reviews matches → sends invites

### Service Communication
- **Frontend → Core Gateway**: REST API with JWT auth
- **Core Gateway → AI Engine**: Internal HTTP calls (FastAPI endpoints)
- **Core Gateway → Database**: Direct PostgreSQL access via Prisma ORM
- All business logic and validation in Core Gateway
- AI Engine stateless (no database access, pure computation)

### Authentication
JWT-based system via Core Gateway (Express). 
- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived, passed via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived, stored in `httpOnly` cookies for security.
- **Auto-Refresh**: Shared Axios client (`libs/shared/api`) handles 401 errors by attempting a token refresh.

All API routes require role-based access control:
- Public routes: `/api/v1/auth/register`, `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/auth/refresh`
- Protected routes: `/api/v1/me`, `/api/v1/students/*`, etc.

### API Design
RESTful conventions (Core Gateway serves all):
- `/api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/v1/students/*` - Student profile operations
- `/api/v1/organizers/*` - Organizer operations
- `/api/v1/hackathons/*` - Event management
- `/api/v1/teams/*` - Team creation, invitations, management
- `/api/v1/matching/*` - AI teammate recommendations (proxied to ai-engine)
- `/api/v1/skills/*` - Skill taxonomy

## Development Workflows

### Docker (Preferred)
Use Docker Compose for a consistent dev environment:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
This starts: Postgres, Core Gateway, AI Engine, and all Frontends.

### Local (Nx)
Use Nx for all build, test, and dev operations:
```bash
# Serve apps in dev mode
nx serve student-portal
nx serve core-gateway
nx serve ai-engine

# Build apps
nx build student-portal
nx build organizer-dashboard
nx build core-gateway

# Run tests
nx test ai-engine
nx test shared-types

# Lint code
nx lint student-portal

# View dependency graph
nx graph

# Run affected (CI optimization)
nx affected:build
nx affected:test
```

### Git & Merge Workflow
- **Branching**: Always create a feature branch (`feat/`), bugfix branch (`fix/`), or chore branch (`chore/`) from `dev`.
- **Pull Requests**: Every merge into the `dev` or `main` branch **must** be performed via a Pull Request (PR). Direct merges or pushes to these branches are prohibited.
- **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commits (see `COMMIT_CONVENTIONS.md`).

### Backend (Core Gateway - Express)
- **Framework**: Express with TypeScript
- **Auth**: JWT with `jsonwebtoken`, password hashing with `bcryptjs`
- **Validation**: `zod` for request payload validation
- **Architecture**: Route-Middleware-Service pattern
- **Database**: PostgreSQL accessed via **Prisma ORM**
- **ORM**: Prisma for schema management, migrations, and type-safe queries

### AI Engine (FastAPI)
- **Framework**: FastAPI with Python 3.11+
- **Models**: Pydantic for request/response
- **Purpose**: Stateless computation service
- **No database access**: Receives data from core-gateway
- **Testing**: pytest for matching logic

### Frontend (Next.js 15+ App Router)
- **Routing**: App Router (`app/` directory) - use layouts, server components
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS (utility-first approach)
- **Shared components**: Import from `@takathon/shared/ui`
- **Shared types**: Import from `@takathon/shared/types`
- **API calls**: Shared Axios client in `@takathon/shared/api` with withCredentials and auto-refresh interceptors
- **State**: Zustand for auth state (`useAuthStore`) - handles token persistence and user info

### Shared Libraries
- **libs/shared/types**: TypeScript type definitions (user, team, hackathon models)
- **libs/shared/ui**: Reusable React/Tailwind components (buttons, inputs, modals)
- **libs/shared/utils**: Common utilities (validators, formatters, constants)
- **libs/python/ai-logic**: Shared Python utilities (embeddings, prompts)

Import shared code:
```typescript
// In Next.js apps
import { Button } from '@takathon/shared/ui';
import { User, Team } from '@takathon/shared/types';
import { validateEmail } from '@takathon/shared/utils';
```

### Docker
Use Docker Compose for local development with:
- Core Gateway service (NestJS)
- AI Engine service (FastAPI)
- Frontend services (Next.js dev servers)
- PostgreSQL container
- Volume mounts for hot-reload

## Key Conventions

1. **Nx Monorepo**: Use Nx commands exclusively for build/test/serve operations
2. **Shared Libraries**: Maximize code reuse through `libs/shared/*` - avoid duplication across apps
3. **Service boundaries**: AI Engine has clean input/output schemas (JSON) - no database access
4. **Database migrations**: Core Gateway owns database schema - use ORM migrations (Prisma)
5. **JWT handling**: Store in httpOnly cookies (frontend) and validate on every protected route (backend)
6. **Error responses**: Standardize API error format (status code, message, details)
7. **State management**: Use Zustand minimally - fetch from API, don't over-cache
8. **Type safety**: Use shared types from `@takathon/shared/types` for API contracts
9. **Component reuse**: Build UI components in `libs/shared/ui` for use across all frontends
10. **Nx constraints**: Respect module boundaries - apps can import from libs but not other apps

## Testing Strategy

Strategic coverage (not 90% blanket coverage):
- **Core Gateway**: NestJS testing framework for API endpoints and business logic
- **AI Engine**: pytest for matching algorithm logic and scoring functions
- **Frontend**: Jest/React Testing Library for critical user flows
- **Shared Libraries**: Unit tests for utilities and validators in `libs/shared/utils`
- **Integration**: End-to-end team creation and AI matching with sample participant data
- **Priority**: Auth flows, team creation/invitations, AI matching recommendations, role-based access control

Use Nx to run tests:
```bash
# Test specific app
nx test ai-engine

# Test all affected by changes
nx affected:test

# Test shared library
nx test shared-utils
```

## Deployment

Target platforms: Render or DigitalOcean
- Docker-based deployment
- GitHub Actions for CI (linting, tests)
- Environment variables for secrets (DB URL, JWT secret)

## Future Considerations

The matching engine is V1 (rule-based) and lives in `apps/ai-engine/app/matching/`. Design interfaces to allow:
- Swapping in ML-based scoring (replace scoring.py) for better teammate recommendations
- A/B testing different matching algorithms
- Performance metrics collection (match acceptance rate, team success)
- Extraction to separate package only when reused across multiple platforms

**Important**: Matching is opt-in and student-driven, not mandatory bulk team generation by organizers
